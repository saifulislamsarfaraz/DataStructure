/**
    In the following function, you will be given a
    valid infix arithmetic expression, and you will
    have to find its equivalent postfix representation.

    The operators in the expression will either be + (plus),
    -(minus), *(multiplication) and /(integer division, i.e.
    only the integer part of the quotient will be the result
    of the operator (e.g. 5/2=2 not 2.5) should be returned).

    In terms of precedence, remember the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule.
    Multiplication and division will have higher precedence
    than subtraction and addition. The precedence of addition
    and subtraction will be the same. And so will be the
    precedence  of multiplication and division. Additionally
    there may be parantheses (i.e. '(' and ')') and operations
    within  parantheses must gain precedence. The already
    implemented getPrecedence() function above can be used.
    Parantheses should not be included in the postfix expression.


    The operands in the arithmetic expression will each be
    single digit integers.

    The following function will be given a character sequence "infix"
    and its length "len", and an initially empty character sequence
    titled "postfix". Your implementation should fill up the postfix
    array in accordance to the postfix order.

    If you implement the function correctly, you will gain 10 marks.

    The following function function should take a postfix expression

    sequence, all the operands are single digit integers and the operators
    are /, +, -, *. The / stands for integer division, i.e. only the integer
    portion of the quotient will be its results, e.g. 5/2=2.

    The function takes the postfix expression as a string and its length as
    its arguments, and it should return the integer value of the expression.

    In case of postfix evaluation, you might want to implement an integer stack.
    In that case, feel free to fill up the following empty functions in the
    following structure, IntStack. Feel free to copy paste the implementations from
    your previous stack structure.

    [You can also implement stacks and queues as templates in the future. That way you
    can avoid having to write the same code again and again for different data types.
